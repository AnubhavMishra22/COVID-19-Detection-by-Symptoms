This project is our contribution to helping to analyze the probability of a person having the infection. Technologies that were made to convert information so that it can be accessible to computers are used to aid people and I can contribute to a social cause.  COVID 19 Detector is a Web Application Prototype Developed by ME and built for Doctors to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity by finding out the probability of a person having the infection.
In light of the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation. One day I was reading the news that CoronaVirus is spreading very quickly and highly developed countries like the USA and Italy are not capable of handling this virus. Most striking news was earlier it takes up to 2 days for just testing whether the patient is COVID positive or not. Then after some advancements also, it is taking some hours to test. So, I thought there should be the minimum time to test this virus so that actions can be taken as soon as possible because of its highly contagious nature.

COVID 19 Detector is a Web Application Prototype Developed by ME and built for Doctors to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity by finding out the probability of a person having the infection. It takes the symptoms of the patient and within seconds it will try to predict the probability whether the patient may be positive for coronavirus or not.
